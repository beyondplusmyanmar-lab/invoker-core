# Pilot Start Record — Invoker v0.2.0-rc1

Fill this in on Day 1, on the shop laptop. The fields left as `<…>` /
`YYYY-MM-DD` can only be known there; everything else is pinned to the build.

**Identity (shop / laptop / operator) is NOT recorded in this public repo.** It
lives only in the git-ignored `pilot/identity.json` (seeded automatically on the
first `scripts/pilot-collect` run). The committed records carry a redacted
`shop_label` from `pilot-meta.json` instead. The pilot **clock** is owned by the
runtime — `doctor --pilot` writes `pilot_started_at` into the workspace and
reports `daysRunning`/`daysTarget`; the repo never duplicates the day count, it
only pins the **start SHA** (`pilot-meta.json` → `start_sha`) for the drift check.

**Status:** ACTIVE (once started)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Started at | owned by runtime (`pilot_started_at` in workspace) |
| Shop | redacted → `shop_label` in `pilot-meta.json`; real value in local `pilot/identity.json` |
| Laptop | local `pilot/identity.json` only (never committed) |
| Operator | local `pilot/identity.json` only (never committed) |
| Build | v0.2.0-rc1 (tag `9e8972d`) |
| Git head | `start_sha` in `pilot-meta.json` (drift-checked each run) |
| Protocol | [PILOT.md](PILOT.md) |
| Expected review date | `YYYY-MM-DD` (= start date + 6 days, end of Day 7) |
| Freeze | ENFORCED |
| Day | 1 / 7 |

**Allowed changes:** bug fixes · observability improvements · pilot
documentation · incident analysis

**Forbidden changes:** rc2 · Chat page · Settings page · multi-device ·
placement · replay · leases · epochs · relay · P3

**Morning snapshot directory:** `pilot/`

**Notes:**
- Pilot initiated.
- No known gate failures.
- Awaiting first morning ledger row.

## Optional: Standalone Binary

The pilot can run from source (`bun run …`, or `bun link` to get an `invoker`
command). To remove Bun as a dependency on the operator's laptop, build one
self-contained binary instead:

```bash
bun build ./src/transports/cli/index.ts --compile --outfile invoker
./invoker init
./invoker doctor
```

The standalone binary embeds the runtime and schema — **Bun is not required on
the pilot laptop.** All three execution modes behave equivalently: `bun run`,
the compiled binary, and a future package install.

## Pilot Contract: What Counts as a Report

The gates evaluate reports produced through the **report/job path** — a
`run`, a scheduled cron tick, or a UI run — each of which writes a manifest.
An ad-hoc `invoker invoke <capability>` produces a valid artifact but **no
manifest**, so `doctor`'s "latest report verifies" check will read FAIL. That
is expected, not a gate failure. During the pilot, exercise reports via jobs,
not bare `invoke`.

## Start Sequence (Day 1, on the laptop)

```bash
# Start the scheduler. Use `start` (detached) not `run` (foreground): `run`
# dies when its terminal closes, which would silently break the Uptime gate.
# A closed laptop is fine — CatchUp catches missed ticks on wake (cache hit).
invoker daemon start

# Optional: outbound notification listener (env-configured)
invoker notifications listen   # foreground; supervise or run in its own window

# Record the start instant for this file
date

# First morning snapshot — establishes the pilot window (doctor --pilot writes
# pilot_started_at) and the Day-1 baseline.
scripts/pilot-collect
```

After this there is intentionally nothing to engineer. For seven days:

1. Run `scripts/pilot-collect` each morning. It writes the snapshot, runs the
   build-drift check, and **auto-appends the ledger row** (machine columns from
   `doctor.json`; raw snapshot under `pilot/` is the source of truth).
2. Fill in `pilot/<stamp>/notes.txt` — operator observations are the **only**
   manual evidence; everything else is machine-generated.
3. Archive any gate-failing snapshot.
4. Apply the smallest bug fix **only** if a gate fails.

## What the Pilot Measures

The pilot validates the **runtime workspace**, not the repository. The repo
carries only the protocol and tooling; the workspace (default `~/.invoker/`,
or `$INVOKER_HOME`) holds everything under test:

```
~/.invoker/
├── invoker.sqlite          # jobs · runs · artifact index · notifications · heartbeats
│   (+ invoker.sqlite-wal / -shm during active use)
├── daemon.lock             # present only while the daemon is running (RSS sample reads its pid)
├── invoker.log             # lifecycle timeline (rolling, size-capped)
└── artifacts/
    ├── *.xlsx · *.docx      # the reports
    └── *.manifest.json      # tamper-evident sidecars
```

Notifications are **rows in `invoker.sqlite`**, not a `notifications/` folder;
the support bundle surfaces them as `notifications.json`.

Each `scripts/pilot-collect` run produces:

```
pilot/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/
├── doctor.json · health.json · rss.txt · meta.txt · notes.txt
└── support/
    └── support-<YYYYMMDD>.zip
```

`pilot/` is git-ignored and never committed.

## Day 7 Review

Evidence-driven, from the ledger + snapshots + bundles + operator comments:

| Gate | Result |
|------|--------|
| Uptime ≥ 7d | ? |
| Duplicate renders | ? |
| Corrupt artifacts | ? |
| Missed cron reports | ? |
| SQLite recovery failures | ? |
| Disk exhaustion | ? |
| Operator confusion incidents | ? |
| Memory growth bounded | ? |

Three outcomes:

- **All gates pass** → unfreeze rc2.
- **A gate fails but is understood** → smallest fix, rerun the pilot.
- **Inconclusive** → extend the pilot window.

The pilot itself is the next deliverable — not another branch.
